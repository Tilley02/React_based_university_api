# React_based_university_api
This is my frontend interface made for the university API I was working with. You can search through students' profiles, degrees, cohorts and subjects/ courses. Can also create or delete existing students, degrees, cohorts and courses

## Info about files
* videolink.txt is a link to a video on YouTube of me going through the website and showing its functionality and also the code

* The assignment-2 directory has the files and other folders containing the code, src/components has the majority of the functions used in the project, and the other .js files are visible from here also
